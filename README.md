# eBaydle
Worlde game where users are prompted with a web scrapped ebay item and have to correctly guess the price. Prompted with a higher or lower message when entering an incorrect guess.

Still in early stages of development. Have successfully been able to scrape products and download their images.

## Pip Libraries Installation
To install the libraries required to scrape, run this command:
```sh
pip install -r libraries.txt
```
